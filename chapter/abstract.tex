Recent technological developments led to boost computational and networking capabilities of everyday objects. 
This situation has resulted in an increase in the number of devices embedded in cyber-physical systems.
In order to simplify the design and management of pervasive and heterogeneous systems like these, new high-level paradigms are needed that are able to capture concerns like heterogeneity and location of the devices.
Aggregate computing is one of these.
It proposes to describe the global behaviour of a system by managing global spatio-temporal data structures, and abstracting details of its physical network, as network topology and devices communication technology.
Verifying the behaviour of a complex pervasive system in a real scenario is generally expensive, complicated, and not always possible in practice.
A solution, to partially test these systems, is with platforms that enable simulations of this kind of systems.

In the Internet-of-Things context, an emergent and enabling communication technology for situated devices is LoRaWAN.
It is a network protocol that allows long range communication and low energy consumption, with the drawback of limited data rate.

Considering all, the purpose of this thesis is to start filling the network abstraction gap of the aggregate paradigm beginning with supporting aggregate computing over LoRaWAN networks.
To do so two main activities were carried out: design the support for Protelis, which is a language for aggregate computing, over LoRaWAN, and provide a simulation platform for this kind of systems.
